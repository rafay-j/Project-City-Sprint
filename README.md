#Overview
This c++ program is initiated by first matching the input stations with the stations that are saved on
file and the return specific values if the entered station is available or not. The program then
calculates the minimum distance using dijktras algorithm which uses dynamic arrays for
example of type bool which indicates whether the nodes are visited or not and then the distance
is calculated according to the applied logic of dijktras algorithm which is to increment the
distance of minimum found path to the distance array which eventually leads to the shortest
possible distance at the end of the program.
